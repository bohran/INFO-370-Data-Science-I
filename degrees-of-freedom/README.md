# GDP and Perceived Freedoms

#### Project Description
It is generally thought that an economically prosperous country has a higher standard of living, lower poverty rates, and general happiness and freedom of citizens, than a country that is not as economically prosperous. However, countries with the highest GDP’s, like China for example, can have staggeringly high poverty rates due to wealth disparity, political regimes, and civil justice violations (Economic Development and Cultural Change, University of Chicago). 

In many capitalistic societies especially, higher income allows for better opportunities in education, nutrition, and protection of rights and freedoms. This puts individuals who are not as economically advantaged at an unequal stance among their fellow citizens, which can result in a lack of basic rights and living needs being met, and restricted opportunity to flourish (Sage Journals). Researchers in South Africa agree there is a “dynamic causal relationship between financial development, economic growth and poverty,” (The Journal of Socioeconomics) and the overarching purpose of our project is to explore the correlations between economic prosperity of a country with the basic rights and freedoms of its citizens. Our intent is to promote awareness of social justice in the sphere of economic development, and shed light on the impact of economic and social inequality from the broad view of countries and regimes. 

We will be testing our hypothesis of whether countries with higher GDP’s have higher freedom rankings as defined by the Human Freedom Index.
