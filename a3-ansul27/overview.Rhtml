<h1> Dengue Fever Overview </h1>

<h2> Understanding Dengue Fever </h2>
<p>Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne, viral disease that is prominent in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The disease causes flu-like symptoms such as rash, high fever, and muscle/joint pain and in serious cases, death. The disease is transmitted mainly through mosquito bites by the urban yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) which are principle carriers of the infection. The number of cases of Dengue fever has rapidly increased in the past three decades due to changes in environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation and climate, leaving more than half the world’s population at risk of contracting the disease. It has been found that these mosquitoes reproduce and bite humans more frequently at higher temperatures. While dengue fever has become an epidemic as of late, there is still no specific, curative treatment that has been found.</p>

<p>Not only does Dengue fever have serious health implications on those affected, but there are also social and economic burdens that arise globally. The mosquitoes who carry this infection breed in “artificial water containers” and such habitats have been found in urban areas at an increasing rate. To combat this, communities have tried using insecticide sprays and organized clean up campaigns to help alleviate the mosquito habitats however found no lasting results. Significant economic effort is required from communities to create methods in controlling the outbreak of Dengue such as investing in biological research, chemical tools, and awareness events to inform people of Dengue fever and how to prevent it. This has serious implications for low-income, developing countries who are at most risk of contracting the fever. Along with the health and economic burdens that Dengue fever brings, there are also many social implications. This disease affects both adult and children alike, which severly impacts family life. Many families are forced to quit their jobs either from being sick themselves, or to take care of loved ones who have been impacted by the disease. Efforts for forecasting Dengue fever is important to allow health agencies better organize information about treatments and fight life-threatening pandemics. </p>


<p>The dataset was provided by DataDriven.org which includes environmental data from San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. The data was collected from various U.S. Federal Government agencies—from the Centers for Disease Control, Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce. The dataset contains variables such as Maximum temperature, Minimum temperature, Average temperature, Total precipitation Diurnal temperature range, Air temperature, Precipiation and Vegetation. These are all important variables to track as they are pertinent to the environment and are transmitted by mosquitoes. In this report, we will explore these variables further and assess how these factors play a role in the number of Dengue fever cases in these two cities.  </p>
